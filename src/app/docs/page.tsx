            SivarETH's support entrepreneurs and small foundations to benefit people in need. SivarETH's approach can be described as a collaborative formula: <br />

          <p className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-800">

            "b" corresponds to the beneficiaries of these entrepreneurs, who also receive education in Web3, and are given access to products and services offered by 'a'. In turn, "b" can learn to use decentralized tools, such as cryptocurrencies, to improve their quality of life and access essential resources.

            The SivarETH model seeks to create a cycle of mutual impact: entrepreneurs ("a") are trained in Web3, improve their businesses, and, thanks to NFT sales and donations, funds are generated to help beneficiaries ("b"). These beneficiaries, in addition to receiving financial support, consume products or services from the participating entrepreneurs, which strengthens local economies and generates synergy between both groups. In the long term, both "a" and "b" benefit, not only economically, but also through learning and adopting new technologies.

            This approach ensures that Web3 technology is used not only as a means of raising funds, but as an educational tool that empowers all those involved, thus creating an inclusive and sustainable ecosystem.
